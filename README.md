## Refactor Monolithic Terraform Configuration
These tutorials are for Terraform users who need to restructure Terraform configurations as they grow. In this tutorial, you will provision two instances of a web application hosted in an S3 bucket that represent production and development environments. The configuration you use to deploy the application will start in as a monolith. You will modify it to step through the common phases of evolution for a Terraform project, until each environment has its own independent configuration and state.
